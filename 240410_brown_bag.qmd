## Connecting GitHub to RStudio for Reproducible Research

**Note:** Brown Bag attendees will learn more from my presentation if they 1) bring their laptop or follow along on Zoom, 2) have [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) loaded already to their machine, and 3) have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account already.

### Make sure that your working directory is set in RStudio

```{r}
#| echo: false
getwd()
#setwd("X:/YOUR PREFERED WORKING DIRECTORY")
```
