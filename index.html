<h1>Let’s get started: What is Reproducible Research?</h1>
<p>Reproducible analysis allow you to automatize how the figures and the statistics in your analysis are generated. This process also helps your collaborators, your readers and your future self to follow your code trail the leads to the original data, increasing the transparency of your science.</p>
<p>Literate analysis help reduce the mistakes from copying and pasting across software, keeps results and models in sync, and allows you to provide interested readers with more information about the different approaches and analyses you tried before coming up with the final results (British Ecological Society (<a href="https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2024-02-arctic/session_03.html#ref-britecolsoc2017">2017</a>)).</p>
<p>Every file in the scientific process changes. Manuscripts are edited. Figures get revised. Code gets fixed when bugs are discovered. Sometimes those fixes lead to even more bugs, leading to more changes in the code base. Data files get combined together. Sometimes those same files are split and combined again. In just one research project, we can expect thousands of changes to occur.</p>
<p>These changes are important to track, and yet, we often use simplistic file names to do so. Many of us have experienced renaming a document or script multiple times with the ingenuine addition of “final” to the file name (like the comic above demonstrates).</p>
<p>You might think there is a better way, and you’d be right: <strong>version control</strong>. Version control provides an organized and transparent way to track changes in code and additional files. This practice was designed for software development, but is easily applicable to scientific programming.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to using a version control software including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maintain a history</strong> of your research project’s development while keeping your workspace clean</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Facilitate collaboration</strong> and transparency when working on teams</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explore bugs or new features</strong> without disrupting your team members’ work</p></li>
<li><p>and more!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The version control system we’ll be diving into is Git, the most widely used modern version control system in the world.</p>
<section id="with-git-we-can-enhance-our-workflow" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="with-git-we-can-enhance-our-workflow">With Git we can enhance our workflow:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Eliminate</strong> the need for <strong>cryptic filenames</strong> and comments to track our work.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide <strong>detailed descriptions of our changes</strong> through commits, making it easier to understand the reasons behind code modifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on multiple <strong>branches</strong> simultaneously, allowing for parallel development, and optionally merge them together.</p></li>
<li><p>Use commits to <strong>access and even execute older versions</strong> of our code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assign meaningful tags</strong> to specific versions of our code.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, Git offers a powerful distributed feature. <strong>Multiple individuals can work on the same analysis concurrently</strong> on their own computers, with the ability to merge everyone’s changes together.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-summary-reproducible-research-is">In Summary, Reproducible Research is:</h2>
<p>Working in a reproducible manner:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increases research efficiency, accelerating the pace of your research and collaborations.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides transparency by capturing and communicating scientific workflows.</p></li>
<li><p>Enables research to stand on the shoulders of giants (build on work that came before).</p></li>
<li><p>Allows credit for secondary usage and supports easy attribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Increases trust in science.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To enable others to fully interpret, reproduce or build upon our research, we need to provide more comprehensive information than is typically included in a figure or publication. The <strong>methods sections of papers are typically inadequate to fully reproduce the work described in the paper</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Computational reproducibility</strong> is the ability to document data, analyses, and models sufficiently for other researchers to be able to understand and ideally re-execute the computations that led to scientific results and conclusions.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, reproducibility includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preserving the data</p></li>
<li><p>Preserving the software workflow</p></li>
<li><p>Documenting what you did</p></li>
<li><p>Describing how to interpret it all</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A recent study of publicly-available datasets in the Harvard Database repository containing R files found that only 26% of R files ran without error in the initial execution. 44% were able to be run after code cleaning, showing the importance of good programming practice (<a href="https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2024-02-arctic/session_20.html#ref-trisovic2022">Trisovic et al.&nbsp;2022</a>). The figure below from Trisovic et al.&nbsp;shows a <em>sankey diagram</em> of how code cleaning was able to fix common errors.</p>

<section id="computational-provenance-and-workflows" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computational-provenance-and-workflows"><strong>Computational Provenance and Workflows</strong></h2>
<p>Computational provenance refers to the origin and processing history of data including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Input data</p></li>
<li><p>Workflow/scripts</p></li>
<li><p>Output data</p></li>
<li><p>Figures</p></li>
<li><p>Methods, dataflow, and dependencies</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When we put these all together with formal documentation, we create a <strong>computational workflow</strong> that captures all of the steps from initial data cleaning and integration, through analysis, modeling, and visualization. In other words, <strong>computational provenance is a formalized description of a workflow from the origin of the data to it’s final outcome</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a computational workflow from Mark Carls: <a href="https://search.dataone.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3A3249ada0-afe3-4dd6-875e-0f7928a4c171">Mark Carls.

Gulf of Alaska Data Portal. urn:uuid:3249ada0-afe3-4dd6-875e-0f7928a4c171.</a>, that represents a three step workflow comprising four source data files and two output visualizations.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-how-local-working-files-git-and-github-all-work-together"><strong>Understanding how local working files, Git, and GitHub all work together</strong></h3>
<p>It can be a bit daunting to understand all the moving parts of the Git / GitHub life cycle (i.e.&nbsp;how file changes are tracked locally within repositories, then stored for safe-keeping and collaboration on remote repositories, then brought back down to a local machine(s) for continued development). It gets easier with practice, but we’ll explain (first in words, then with an illustration) at a high-level how things work:</p>
<section id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-normal-folder-vs.-a-git-repository" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-normal-folder-vs.-a-git-repository">6.2.3.1 What is the difference between a “normal” folder vs.&nbsp;a Git repository</h4>
<p>Whether you’re a Mac or a PC user, you’ll likely have created a folder at some point in time for organizing files. Let’s pretend that we create a folder, called <code>myFolder/</code>, and add two files: <code>myData.csv</code> and <code>myAnalysis.R</code>. The contents of this folder are not currently version controlled – meaning, for example, that if we make some changes to <code>myAnalysis.R</code> that don’t quite work out, we have no way of accessing or reverting back to a previous version of <code>myAnalysis.R</code> (without remembering/rewriting things, of course).</p>
<p>Git allows you to turn any “normal” folder, like <code>myFolder/</code>, into a <strong>Git repository</strong> – you’ll often see/hear this referenced as “initializing a Git repository”. When you initialize a folder on your local computer as a Git repository, a hidden <code>.git/</code> folder is created <em>within</em> that folder (e.g.&nbsp;<code>myFolder/.git/</code>) – this <code>.git/</code> folder <em>is</em> the <strong>Git repository</strong>. As you use Git commands to capture versions or “snapshots” of your work, those versions (and their associated metadata) get stored within the <code>.git/</code> folder. This allows you to access and/or recover any previous versions of your work. If you delete <code>.git/</code>, you delete your project’s history.</p>
<p>Here is our example folder / Git repository represented visually:</p>
<p><img src="240410_brown_bag_files/git-repo.png" class="img-fluid"></p>

<p>The last step is synchronizing the changes made to our local repository with a remote repository (oftentimes, this remote repository is stored on GitHub). The <code>git push</code> command is used to send local commits up to a remote repository. The <code>git pull</code> command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into the local repository – <strong>pull</strong>ing will become a regular part of your workflow when collaborating with others, or even when working alone but on different machines (e.g.&nbsp;a laptop at home and a desktop at the office).</p>
<p>The processes described in the above sections (i.e.&nbsp;making changes to local working files, recording “snapshots” of them to create a versioned history of changes in a local Git repository, and sending those versions from our local Git repository to a remote repository (which is oftentimes on GitHub)) is illustrated using islands, buildings, bunnies, and packages in the artwork, below:</p>

What should I write in my commit message?</strong></p>
<p>Writing effective Git commit messages is essential for creating a meaningful and helpful version history in your repository. It is crucial to avoid skipping commit messages or resorting to generic phrases like “Updates.” When it comes to following best practices, there are several guidelines to enhance the readability and maintainability of the codebase.</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines for writing effective Git commit messages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Be descriptive and concise</strong>: Provide a clear and concise summary of the changes made in the commit. Aim to convey the purpose and impact of the commit in a few words.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use imperative tense</strong>: Write commit messages in the imperative tense, as if giving a command. For example, use “Add feature” instead of “Added feature” or “Adding feature.” This convention aligns with other Git commands and makes the messages more actionable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Separate subject and body</strong>: Start with a subject line, followed by a blank line, and then provide a more detailed explanation in the body if necessary. The subject line should be a short, one-line summary, while the body can provide additional context, motivation, or details about the changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limit the subject line length</strong>: Keep the subject line within 50 characters or less. This ensures that the commit messages are easily scannable and fit well in tools like Git logs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Capitalize and punctuate properly</strong>: Begin the subject line with a capital letter and use proper punctuation. This adds clarity and consistency to the commit messages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on the “what” and “why”</strong>: Explain what changes were made and why they were made. Understanding the motivation behind a commit helps future researchers and collaborators (including you!) comprehend its purpose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use present tense for subject, past tense for body</strong>: Write the subject line in present tense as it represents the current state of the codebase. Use past tense in the body to describe what has been done.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reference relevant issues</strong>: If the commit is related to a specific issue or task, include a reference to it. For example, you can mention the issue number or use keywords like “Fixes,” “Closes,” or “Resolves” followed by the issue number.</p></li>

<h1>Enough of the explanations: Set Up Global Options in Git</h1>
<p>Before using Git, you need to tell it who you are, also known as setting the global options. To do this, we will be setting the global options in the Terminal.</p>
<section id="whats-the-terminal" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-the-terminal">What’s the Terminal?</h2>
<p>Technically, the Terminal is an interface for the shell, a computer program. To put that simply, we use the Terminal to tell a computer what to do. This is different from the Console in RStudio, which interprets R code and returns a value.</p>
</section>
<section id="opening-a-terminal-in-rstudio" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="opening-a-terminal-in-rstudio">Opening a Terminal in RStudio</h2>
<p>To get started, let’s open a new Terminal window in RStudio. Do this by clicking <code>Tools &gt; Terminal &gt; New Terminal</code>.</p>
<p>A Terminal tab should now be open where your Console usually is.</p>
</section>
<section id="dipping-your-toes-in-the-terminal" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dipping-your-toes-in-the-terminal">Dipping Your Toes in the Terminal</h2>
<p>Most of our Git operations will be done in RStudio, but there are some situations where you must work in the Terminal and use command line. It may be daunting to code in the Terminal, but as your comfort increases over time, you might find you prefer it. Either way, it’s beneficial to learn enough command line and to feel comfortable in the Terminal.</p>
</section>
<section id="configuring-git" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="configuring-git">Configuring Git</h2>
<p>Let’s start by adding your user name to the global options. Type the following into the command prompt, with your exact GitHub username, and press enter:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name "my_user_name"</code></pre>
<p>Note that if the code ran successfully, it will look like nothing happened. We will check at the end to make sure it worked.</p>
<p>Next, enter the following line, with the email address you used when you created your account on <a href="www.github.com">github.com</a>:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.email "my_email@alaska.edu"</code></pre>
</section>

<section id="setting-up-git-credentials" class="level1">
<h1>Setting Up Git Credentials</h1>
<p>Next, we will set our credentials to not time out for a very long time. This is related to how our server operating system handles credentials - not doing this will make your Personal Access Token (PAT, which we will set up in the next section) expire immediately on the system, even though it is actually valid for at least a month.</p>
<section id="when-setting-up-git-and-github-on-your-personal-computer" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-setting-up-git-and-github-on-your-personal-computer">When Setting up Git and GitHub on Your Personal Computer</h2>
<p>You will not need to run the <code>git config</code> line below to set the cache. This is a specific configuration for the RStudio Server we are working on.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'</code></pre>
<p>Next, we will set the default branch name to <code>main</code> for any new repositories that are created moving forward. Why are we doing this? Previously, the default branch name was <code>master</code> and this racist terminology for Git branches motivates us to update our default branch to <code>main</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global init.defaultBranch main</code></pre>
<p>Finally, check to make sure everything looks correct by entering this command, which will return the global options you have set.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global --list</code></pre>

<section id="github-authentication" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="github-authentication">2.2.2 GitHub Authentication</h2>
<p>GitHub recently deprecated password authentication for accessing repositories, so we need to set up a secure way to authenticate.</p>
<p>The book <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/"><em>Happy Git and GitHub for the useR</em></a> has a wealth of information related to working with Git in R, and these instructions are based off of <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html">Chapter 9: Personal Access Token for HTTPS</a>.</p>

<h1><strong>Collaborating with trusted colleagues without conflicts</strong></h1>
<p>We start our collaboration by giving a trusted colleague access to our repository on GitHub. In this example, we define the <strong>Owner as the individual who owns the repository</strong>, and the <strong>Collaborator as the person whom the Owner chooses to give permission to make changes to their repository</strong>.</p>
<p>The Collaborator will make changes to the repository and then <code>push</code> those changes to the shared repository on GitHub. The Owner will then use <code>pull</code> to retrieve the changes without encountering any conflicts. <em>This is the most ideal workflow.</em></p>
<p>The instructors will demonstrate this process in the next section.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-0-owner-adds-a-collaborator-to-their-repository-on-github"><strong>Step 0: Owner adds a Collaborator to their repository on GitHub</strong></h3>
<p>The Owner must change the settings of the remote repository and give the Collaborator access to the repository by inviting them as a collaborator. Once the Collaborator accepts the owner’s invitation, they will have push access to the repository – meaning they can contribute their own changes/commits to the Owner’s repository.</p>
<p>To do this, the owner will navigate to their remote repository on GitHub, then choose <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Collaborators</strong> &gt; <strong>Add people</strong>, to send an email invitation. The invitation will show as “Pending” until accepted.</p>

To do this, the Collaborator should navigate to the Owner’s repository on GitHub, then copy the clone URL. In RStudio, the Collaborator will create a new project from version control by pasting this clone URL into the appropriate dialog box.</p>

<section id="merge-conflicts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="merge-conflicts"><strong>Merge conflicts</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Merge conflicts</strong> occur when both collaborators make conflicting changes to the same file. Resolving merge conflicts involves identifying the root of the problem and restoring the project to a normal state. Good communication, discussing file sections to work on, and avoiding overlaps can help prevent merge conflicts. However, if conflicts do arise, Git warns about potential issues and ensures that changes from different collaborators based on the same file version are not overwritten. To resolve conflicts, you need to explicitly specify whose changes should be used for each conflicting line in the file.</p>
<p>In this image, we see collaborators <code>mbjones</code> and <code>metamattj</code> have both made changes to the same line in the same <code>README.md</code> file. This is causing a merge conflict because Git doesn’t know whose changes came first. To resolve it, we need to tell Git whose changes to keep for that line, and whose changes to discard.</p>

<section id="common-ways-to-resolve-a-merge-conflict" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="common-ways-to-resolve-a-merge-conflict"><strong>Common ways to resolve a merge conflict</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Abort, abort, abort…</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you just made a mistake. When you get a merge conflict, the repository is placed in a “Merging” state until you resolve it. There’s a Terminal command to abort doing the merge altogether:</p>
<pre><code>git merge --abort</code></pre>
<p>Of course, after doing that you still haven’t synced with your Collaborator’s changes, so things are still unresolved. But at least your repository is now usable on your local machine.</p>
<p><strong>2. Checkout</strong></p>
<p>The simplest way to resolve a conflict, given that you know whose version of the file you want to keep, is to use the command line to tell Git to use either <strong>your</strong> changes (the person doing the <code>merge</code>), or <strong>their</strong> changes (the Collaborator).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>keep your Collaborator’s file: <code>git checkout --theirs conflicted_file.Rmd</code></p></li>
<li><p>keep your own file: <code>git checkout --ours conflicted_file.Rmd</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have run that command, then run <code>add</code> (staging), <code>commit</code>, <code>pull</code>, and <code>push</code> the changes as normal.</p>
<p><strong>3. Pull and edit the file</strong></p>
<p>Option 2, above, requires the command line, however, we have a third option for resolving the merge conflict from RStudio. Using this approach will allow us to pick and choose some of our changes <em>and</em> some of our Collaborator’s changes by letting us manually edit and fix the conflicted file.</p>
<p>When you <code>pull</code> a file with a conflict, Git will provide you with a warning modify the file so that it includes both your own changes and your Collaborator’s changes. The file will also appear in the <strong>Git</strong> tab with an orange <code>U</code> icon, which indicates that the file is <code>Unmerged</code> and therefore awaiting your help to resolve the conflict. It delimits these blocks of conflicted code with a series of less than and greater than signs, so they are easy to find:</p>
<p><img src="240410_brown_bag_files/rstudio-merge-conflict.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the above example, <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code> marks the start of <em>your</em> changes. The <code>=======</code> delimiter separates your changes from your Collaborator’s conflicting changes. <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> mark the end of your Collaborator’s changes.</p>
<p>To resolve the conflicts, simply find all of these blocks, and edit them so that the file looks how you want (either pick your lines, your Collaborator’s lines, some combination, or something altogether new), and save. Be sure you removed the delimiter lines that started with</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>=======</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have made those changes, you simply <code>add</code> (staging), <code>commit</code>, and <code>push</code> the files to resolve the conflict.Clone a Repository from GitHub to R Studio</p>

<section id="best-practices-to-avoid-merge-conflicts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="best-practices-to-avoid-merge-conflicts"><strong>Best practices to avoid merge conflicts</strong></h2>
<p>Some basic rules of thumb can avoid the vast majority of merge conflicts, saving a lot of time and frustration. These are words our teams live by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Communicate often and set up effective communication channels</p></li>
<li><p>Tell each other what you are working on</p></li>
<li><p>Start your working session with a <code>pull</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Pull</code> immediately after you <code>commit</code> and before you <code>push</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Commit</code> often in small chunks (this helps you organize your work!)</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you and who you are collaborating with all <strong>fully</strong> understand the Git workflow you’re using (aka make sure you’re on the same page before you start)!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A good workflow is encapsulated as follows:</p>
<p><code>Pull -&gt; Edit -&gt; Save -&gt; Add (stage) -&gt; Commit -&gt; Pull -&gt; (OPTIONAL) Fix any merge conflicts -&gt; Push</code></p>
<p>It may take a bit of practice to get comfortable with navigating merge conflicts, but like any other technical skill, they’ll become less intimidating with time. With careful communication and a consistent workflow, conflicts can be largely avoided or resolved when they do occur.</p>

<section id="organizing-an-r-project" class="level1">
<h1>Organizing an R Project</h1>
<p>When starting a new research project, one of the first things I do is create an R Project for it (just like we have here!). The next step is to then populate that project with relevant directories. There are many tools out there that can do this automatically. Some examples are <code>rrtools</code> or <code>usethis::create_package()</code>. The goal is to organize your project so that it is a compendium of your research. This means that the project has all of the digital parts needed to replicate your analysis, like code, figures, the manuscript, and data access.</p>
<section id="common-directories" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="common-directories">Common Directories</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>data</strong>: This is where we store our data. It often contains subdirectories for raw, processed, and metadata data.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>: Contains scripts for cleaning or wrangling, etc. If your work includes scripts beyond the R programming language, this directory can be misleading, and you might prefer to call it <code>scripts</code>.</li>
<li><strong>plots</strong> or <strong>figs</strong>: This is for generated plots, graphs, and figures.</li>
<li><strong>docs</strong>: Here, you can put summaries or reports of analysis or other relevant project information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Directory organization will vary from project to project, but the ultimate goal is to create a well-organized project that supports both reproducibility and collaboration.</p>

<li><p>Leave the output format as HTML and Engine set to Knitr.</p></li>
<li><p>Then click the “Create” button.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing to notice is that by opening a file, we see the fourth pane of the RStudio pops up. This is our Quarto document which is essentially a text editor. We also see in the upper left side that we are looking at the document under the “Visual editor”. This is probably a familiar way of looking at a text document. To introduce the <strong>markdown</strong> syntax, we re going to move to the source editor and then come back to the visual editor. In the upper left corner, click on Source. See how the formatting changed? In the Source editor we are looking at the same text, but in markdown syntax. The visual editor on the other hand, allows us to see how markdown is rendered, therefore how is it going to look in our output document.</p>
<section id="render-the-quarto-document" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="render-the-quarto-document">Render the Quarto document</h2>
<p>Let’s go ahead and render this file by clicking the “Render” button, next to the blue arrow at the top of the Quarto file. When you first click this button, RStudio will prompt you to save this file. Save it in the top level of your home directory on the server, and name it something that you will remember (like <code>quarto-intro.Rmd</code>).</p>
<p>Notice how the grey <strong>R code chunks</strong> are surrounded by 3 back-ticks and <code>{r LABEL}</code>. The first chunk, in this case <code>1+1</code>, is evaluated and return the output number (2). Notice the line in the second chunk that says <code>#| echo: false</code>? This is a code chunk option that indicates not to print the code. In the rendered version, we can see the outcome of <code>2*2</code> but not the executed code that created the outcome.</p>
<p>The table below show some of the options available to customizing outputs (<a href="https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html">Quarto.org</a>).</p>

</section>
<section id="adding-citations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-citations"><strong>Adding citations</strong></h2>
<p>To add a citation, go to the visual editor and in the insert drop down, select “Citation.” In the window that appears, there are several options in the left hand panel for the source of your citation. If you have a citation manager, such as Zotero, installed, this would be included in that list. For now, select “From DOI”, and in the search bar enter a DOI of your choice (e.g.: 10.1038/s41467-020-17726-z), then select “Insert.”</p>
<p>After selecting insert, a couple of things happen. First, the citation reference is inserted into your markdown text as <code>[@oke2020]</code>. Second, a file called references.bib containing the BibTex format of the citation is created. Third, that file is added to the YAML header of your Quarto document (<code>bibliography: references.bib</code>). Adding another citation will automatically update your <code>references.bib</code> file. So easy!</p>
<p>Every time when opening a new Quarto document we should start by deleting all template text (everything except for the YAML). Then we save the document into the most convenient folder of our project. Now we are ready to start our work.</p>
<p>You can create a new chunk in your Quarto in one of these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to Code in the top menu bar, click “Insert Chunk”</p></li>
<li><p>Type by hand <code>{r}</code></p></li>
<li><p>Use the keyboard shortcut</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mac:<code>command</code> + <code>option</code> + <code>i</code></p></li>
<li><p>Windows: <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>i</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="about-code-chunks" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-code-chunks"><strong>About code chunks</strong></h3>
<p>Each code chunk needs to have an opening syntax ```<code>{r}</code> and a closing syntax ```. Everything in between these lines will be identified as R code. Let’s start by creating a new R chunk and run the following functions. Because this just an exploration and we do not want this chunk to be part of our report, we will indicate that by adding <code>#|eval: false</code> and <code>#| echo: false</code> in the setup of the chunk, that way, the code in this chunk will not run and not be displayed when I knit the final document.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practice</strong></p>
<p>It is generally good practice to include all of your <code>library()</code> calls in a single, dedicated R chunk near the top of your document. This lets collaborators know what packages they might need to install before they start running your code.</p>

<p>Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger &amp; Lincoln Mullen (2018) <strong>Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends)</strong>, The American Statistician, 72:1, 80-88, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986">doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The key idea in Marwick et al.&nbsp;(2018) is that of the <em>research compendium</em>: A single container for not just the journal article associated with your research but also the underlying analysis, data, and even the required software environment required to reproduce your work.</p>
<p>Research compendium makes it easy for researchers to do their work but also for others to inspect or even reproduce the work because all necessary materials are readily at hand due to being kept in one place. Rather than a constrained set of rules, the research compendium is a scaffold upon which to conduct reproducible research using open science tools such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">RMarkdown</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></p></li>

<p>Fortunately for us, Ben Marwick (and others) have written an R package called <a href="https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools">rrtools</a> that helps us create a research compendium from scratch.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the structure <code>rrtools</code> has put in place for us. Inside the analysis folder we have 5 folders. Different parts of our project will go into this different folders. Our data into the <code>data</code> folder, when the time comes to save any figure, we should save them into the <code>figures</code> folder, and so on.</p>

</div>
<p>You’ll notice a <code>analysis/templates</code> directory that contains journal citation style language (CSL) files which set the style of citations and reference list for the journal (the Journal of Archaeological Science, in this example). The template.Rmd renders into the template.docx. This document is called in the paper.qmd YAML to style the output of the paper created in paper.qmd.</p>
<p>What if I want a template from another journal, different from the Journal of Archeological Science? We can create other journal’s template with the <code>rticles</code> package. This package will provide the templates and necessary information to render your paper in the journal of your choice (note: not all journal are in the <code>rticles</code> package). With that in mind, we will delete the existing <code>paper</code> directory and create a new one shortly.</p>
<p><strong>Additional information on RMarkdown templates with <code>rticles</code> can be found here <a href="https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2024-02-arctic/session_20.html#rmarkdown-templates-with-rticles" class="uri">https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2024-02-arctic/session_20.html#rmarkdown-templates-with-rticles</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use <code>rrtools</code> to generate the core directory layout and approach to data handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Then use <code>rticles</code> to create the structure of the paper itself. The combination is incredibly flexible.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Things we can do with our research compendium:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Edit <code>./analysis/paper/paper.Rmd</code> to begin writing your paper and your analysis in the same document</p></li>
<li><p>Add any citations to <code>./analysis/paper/pnas-sample.bib</code></p></li>
<li><p>Add any longer R scripts that don’t fit in your paper in an <code>R</code> folder at the top level</p></li>
<li><p>Add raw data to <code>./data/raw_data</code></p></li>
<li><p>Write out any derived data (generated in <code>paper.Rmd</code>) to <code>./data/derived_data</code></p></li>
<li><p>Write out any figures in <code>./analysis/figures</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can then write all of your R code in your RMarkdown/Quarto, and generate your manuscript all in the format needed for your journal (using it’s .csl file, stored in the paper directory).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-renv-to-conserve-your-environment"><strong>Adding <code>renv</code> to conserve your environment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><code>rrtools</code> has a couple more tricks up it’s sleeve to help your compendium be as reproducible and portable as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>To capture the R packages and versions this project depends on, we can use the <code>renv</code> package.</p></li>
<li><p>Running <code>renv::init()</code>, will initiate tracking of the R packages in your project.</p></li>
<li><p>This action will create a new folder called <code>renv</code> in your top directory.</p></li>
<li><p><code>renv::init()</code> automatically detects dependencies in your code (by looking for library calls, at the DESCRIPTION file, etc.) and installs them to a private project specific library. This means that your project <code>mypaper</code> can use a different version of <code>dplyr</code> than another project which may need an older version without any hassle.</p></li>
<li><p><code>renv</code> also write the package dependencies to a special file in the repository called <code>renv.lock</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If any of your packages you are using is updated, while your are working on your project, you can run <code>renv::snapshot()</code> to update the <code>renv.lock</code> file and your project-installed packages.</p></li>
<li><p>You can read the <code>renv.lock</code> file using <code>renv::restore()</code>, when needed. This will install the versions of the packages needed.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conserve-your-computational-environment-with-docker" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conserve-your-computational-environment-with-docker"><strong>Conserve your computational environment with Docker</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>rrtools</code> package then uses this <code>renv.lock</code> file to build what is called a Dockerfile.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.docker.com/"><strong>Docker</strong></a> <strong>allows you to build containers, a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so an application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A container is an “image” of all the software specified, and this image can be run on other computers such that the software stack looks exactly as you specify.</p></li>
<li><p>This is important when it comes to reproducibility, because when running someone else code, you may get different results or errors if you are using different versions of software (like an old version of <code>dplyr</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>A Dockerfile contains the instructions for how to recreate the computational environment where your analysis was run.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In practice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once you have your research compendium, you can called <code>rrtools::use_dockerfile()</code>. If needed, re-install <code>rrtools</code> directly from GitHub <code>remotes::install_github("benmarwick/rrtools")</code></p></li>
<li><p>This, first creates a Dockerfile that loads a standard image for using R with the tidyverse,</p></li>
<li><p>And then has more instructions for how to create the environment so that it has the very specific R packages and versions you need.</p></li>
<li><p>If we look at the Dockerfile (example below), it calls to <code>renv::restore()</code>, as described above.</p></li>
<li><p>The last line of the docker file renders our Quarto/RMarkdown reproducible paper!</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code># get the base image, the rocker/verse has R, RStudio and pandoc FROM rocker/verse:4.2.2  
# required MAINTAINER Your Name &lt;your_email@somewhere.com&gt;  

COPY . /&lt;REPO&gt; 

# go into the repo directory 
RUN . /etc/environment \   

# Install linux depedendencies here   
# e.g. need this for ggforce::geom_sina   
&amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update \   
&amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev -y \   
# build this compendium package   
&amp;&amp; R -e "install.packages('remotes', repos = c(CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))" \   
&amp;&amp; R -e "remotes::install_github(c('rstudio/renv', 'quarto-dev/quarto-r'))" \   
# install pkgs we need   
&amp;&amp; R -e "renv::restore()" \   
# render the manuscript into a docx, you'll need to edit this if you've   
# customised the location and name of your main qmd file   
&amp;&amp; R -e "quarto::quarto_render('/&lt;REPO&gt;/analysis/paper/paper.qmd')"</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>After running <code>rrtools::use_dockerfile()</code>, the package also sets up GitHub Actions for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Actions are processes that are triggered in GitHub events (like a push) and run automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>In this case, the Action that is set up will build your Docker image on GitHub.</p></li>
<li><p>This means that the code that knits your paper is run, and an updated version of your paper is knit.</p></li>
<li><p>This is called <strong>continuous integration,</strong> and is extremely convenient for developing products like this, since the build step can be taken care of automatically as you push to your repository.</p></li>
